        <H4>Q. Who is it for?</H4>
        <p>A: You can use Spark with all your groups, including friends, family, sports clubs, interest groups, wedding guests and parents and kids&quot; clubs.</p>

        <H4>Q. When will the app be launched?</H4>
        <p>A: SPARK is coming soon. Please enter your email below to be notified as soon as it&quot;s ready.</p>

        <H4>Q. Why shouldn’t I just use Facebook?</H4>
        <p>A: With Spark you can poll groups of people, so you can let everybody choose to what to do.&nbsp; A picnic or an afternoon tea with granny? Karting or paintballing for the stag do? Or a friday drink in Soho or Shoreditch (yes, you can poll on location and dates too)?</p>
        <p>Then you can share the pictures within the group, which means even granny will be able to see the pictures that all the family took of her birthday and Dave’s stag do pictures will only be seen by the people who were at the stag do (it’s probably better this way).</p>
        <p>It’s easy to miss Facebook event notifications in an endless stream of adverts, baby photos and status updates.&nbsp; Spark is a new app solely for events, and is designed specially for use with events.&nbsp; Spark’s is designed so you can organise the best parties, get consensus on the best dates for a holiday, and decide who’s coming to the next hot ticket in town.</p>

For the purposes of these Terms, both the website and application shall be referred to as the &quot;App&quot;. The App is operated by Wanna Enterprises Ltd trading as Spark (we, us and our). We are a limited company, registered in England. Our registered company number is 7934000, and our registered office is at 1 Neptune House, Moodkee St, London, UK, SE16 7AU. Our VAT registration number is 138597273.<br/><br/>1.2 Your use of the App and your Purchase of any of the Products offered via our App is subject to these Terms and by logging in to our App you agree to be bound by them. You should print a copy of these Terms for future reference. Use of your personal information submitted via this App is governed by our privacy policy.<br/><br/>1.3 We reserve the right to change these Terms from time to time by changing them on the App, although no such change will affect any Purchase you have already made with us. Your continued use of the App and any new Purchases will be bound by the new Terms. These Terms were last updated on July 12, 2016.<br/><br/>1.4 As a consumer, nothing in these Terms will prevent you or stop you from being able to enforce or receive the full benefit of your legal rights provided under general UK law (your &quot;non-excludable statutory rights&quot;). For more information, please contact your local Citizens Advice Bureau, phone numbers can be found on their national website at www.nacab.org.uk.<br/><br/>1.5 In these Terms we use various capitalised terms (they are &quot;defined&quot;). This means they have special meanings, found in the next-to-last section of these Terms.</p>

//    <p class="Paragraph-text" id="u62156-80">2.1 To use the App and make any Purchases, you must be 18 or over. By continuing to use the App and agreeing to these Terms you are representing to us that you are 18 and we can rely on this representation.<br/><br/>2.2 The App and the Events offered on the App are only directed at people who access the App and make Purchases in the UK. We do not represent that any Events are suitable outside the UK and you should be careful to satisfy yourself of a Event's suitability to your circumstances (such as considering your travel arrangements to/from the event because unless this is expressly stated as part of the Event, it is not included as part of the Purchase). If you choose to use the App or make a Purchase outside the UK you do so at your own initiative.<br/><br/>2.3 We grant you a limited licence to use the App to access and use our services for your own personal and non-commercial use, provided that you comply fully with these Terms.<br/><br/>2.4 We reserve the right to prevent you using the App or making Purchases, however we will honour Purchases already made, unless you have not complied with these Terms or we are unable to because of circumstances outside our control. For more on this, please read below.</p>

//    <p class="Paragraph-text" id="u62156-91">3.1 We cannot guarantee the continuous, uninterrupted or error-free operability of the App. There may be times when certain features, parts or content of the App, or the entire App, become unavailable (whether on a scheduled or unscheduled basis) or are modified, suspended or withdrawn by us, in our sole discretion, without notice to you. You agree that we will not be liable to you or to any third party for any unavailability, modification, suspension or withdrawal of the App, or any features, parts or content of the App.<br/><br/>3.2 We may change the format and content of the App from time to time. We reserve the right to modify, change, substitute or withdraw any Events or other information on our App. You agree that your use of the App is on an 'as is' and 'as available' basis and at your sole risk.</p>

//    <p class="Paragraph-text" id="u62156-108">4.1 Why register? To put simply, if you don't register an account, you won't be able to make any Purchases. This is because you need an account in order to view your Purchased Products, redeem them (if required), view your past Purchases, store your financial details and modify your preferences to name a few. We reserve the right to decline a new registration or cancel your account at any time (including if you don't provide us with a valid e-mail address that is personal to you, or if you don't provide us with a correct name and surname).<br/><br/>4.2 To register an account you will need to fill out a form on the mobile app or online. You warrant that the information you input is true, complete and accurate. You will promptly inform us of any changes to such information (you can do this by updated your account details at any time). The personal information you give us is governed by our privacy policy.<br/><br/>4.3 In order to register and access your account, you will need to choose a password. It is important you keep this password confidential because you are entirely responsible if you do not maintain the confidentiality of your password to a reasonably expected standard and Purchases are made via your account. Let us know as soon as you become aware there has been a breach of security and we will suspend your account. You agree that any person who you directly or implicitly permit to use your password (implicitly, for example, because you do not log out of your account and another person uses your device to make Purchases or you write your password on a noticeboard in your home and a family member then uses it to gain access to your account) is authorised to act as your agent to use the App and make Purchases via your account. You will not be responsible to pay for Purchases made after you have notified us of a password change or that security has been compromised.<br/><br/>4.4 One individual user is allowed to register only one account on the App. You warrant that you will not create fraudulent accounts. You also warrant that you will not use any fraudulent activities to generate unfair Reward Credits in the App to be applied to you (for instance, you will not redeem your own invitation code with a different account of yours).</p>

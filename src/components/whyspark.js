        <p>Peter: "Before I had Spark, I would get to lunchtime with 100s of new messages in my mates' Whatsapp group.  Anytime somebody mentioned a date or a place to meet, I'd have tonscroll through hundreds of messages tonfind the time to meet or the venue.  Now i can just use Whatsapp for banter and sharing invites and rely on Spark to keep tje important details in one place
 Its so easy to find them now."</p>
